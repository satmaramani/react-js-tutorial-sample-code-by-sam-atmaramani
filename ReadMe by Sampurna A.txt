Instructions to understand and run the sample code from this Tutorial series 
############################################################################


1) Each folder contains one react JS topic 
2) Folder title is given for easy understanding of the topic
2) All the above folders contains each topic code mentioned in the folder name 
3) This react starter kit is sufficient for any beginner to understand how React works
4) In order to start understanding the code, you need to go to src/App.js file and start tracing the code 
5) I have removed the node_modules folder from each topic folder because of its size, 
	hence you need to create the node_module by following command 
	
	a) npm install 	=> It will install the dependencies within 2-3 minutes and node_modules folder will be created

	b) npm start 	=> It will start the server on port 3000 by default 

	c) In case your port 3000 is busy or you want to run on another port, go to .env file and give the following port settings
		PORT=4000 <example is given to start the npm start on port 4000

6) This code is tested on React JS 18 Version
